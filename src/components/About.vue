        I graduated from Drury University in 2012 with a major in Computer Information Systems.
        For two years, I worked as an inventory expert at RGIS, where I learned a great deal
        about hard work, teamwork, and responsibility, while providing clients with accurate
        and efficient annual inventory audits. Before that, I held a brief internship at Meyer
        Accounting and Tax, LLC, where I worked with them to gather information regarding their
        needs and concerns, and developed a new database and company website to meet their
        specifications.

        In 2016, I graduated from Centriq Training where I trained to become a .NET developer.
        Although I come from a family of developers, I didn't become interested in programming
        until my freshman year of college, when I tried my hand at designing my own computer game
        and absolutely fell in love. It was so exciting to build the logic piece by piece,
        find solutions to the various problems I came across, and watch my very own creation come to
        life. I've learned a great deal from designing my own games, including how to research the
        market, collaborate with a team, and design a user-friendly interface, and of course I've
        also benefited from the hands-on programming experience.

        Currently, I'm working as a Principal Engineer/Architect at MSTS. My job involves working on
        both independent and team-based development projects to support internal business users as
        well as external clients.
